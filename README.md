# MoviesProject
## Description
* Movies subscription web based on React.js/Node.js/MongoDB 

### What was good:
* Making the Database and fetch the API's into collections
* Importing the data to the server and client


### Difficulties: 
* The design process didn't went well, had problems with installing tailwind so my design based on css only.
* Did not make a filter function on the movies 
* Did not make a remove function from localStorage
* Did not make a members manegment 
* Did not make a subscribtions page
